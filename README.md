- How to connect all the components:
  ### RC wiring
![Controller schematic](circuits_schematics/Controller_circuit.png)

### Drone wiring
![Drone schematic](circuits_schematics/Drone_circuit.png)
  - Fix the polarity of each motors so the rotation direction of each motor matches the fellowing picture:
     <img
    src="img/motors_orientation.jpg"
    alt="drone"
    width=100%
      />
  - solder each of them on a seperate soldering board.
  - change the SSID and the PASSWORD on the [`camera script`](camera/CameraWebServer/CameraWebServer.ino) to your wifi' ssid and password:
  ```c
  //change these if needed
  const char *ssid = "elbo7's" ;
  const char *password = "NiggaNigga";
  ```
- Upload the code to each board:
  - upload [`lcd screen script`](controller_lcd/controller_lcd.ino) to the arduino nano controlling the LCD screen.
  - upload [`rc controller script`](controller_cmds/controller_cmds.ino) to the arduino nano controlling the remote controller.
  - upload [`flight sensors script`](flight_sensors/flight_sensors.ino) to the arduino nano controlling the MPU6050 and NEO-6M.
  - upload [`flight command script`](flight_cmds/flight_cmds.ino) to the arduino nano controlling the BLDC motors.
- ****üöÅ Take off!****

### üõ†Ô∏è Be cautious
- When labeling the BLDC motors in a clockwise direction: **1st** and **3rd**motors are spinning **Counter ClockWise**, **2nd** and **4th** spinning **ClockWise**.
- The drone **doesn't have** a **protocol** for when it **loses connection** with the RC. **In other words, it will hold the last inputs until it regain connection or motors keep spinning until battery dies**.
- **Emergency Landing** and **CutOffEngine** are **irreversible**. After these actions are engaged, disconnect the battery then reconnect it again if you want to fly the drone(**THIS WAS A SAFETY DESIGN**).
- ‚ùå The Drone is uncapable of doing diagonal movements. **So DO NOT move the joysticks is cross patterns!**
- ‚ùå No failsafe when RC disconnects

## üöÄ It's Flight Time
Follow these procedures:
- 1st: Power on the RC and **WAIT** for the animation to finish.

    alt="drone"
    width=100%
  />
- 2nd: Connect the battery connector and wait for the lights to flash.
  <img
    src="img/drone_flash_lights.gif"
    alt="drone"
    width=100%
  />
- 3rd: On the RC, click on the blue button (the toggle light) to see if there is a solid connection between thedrone and the RC.
- 4th: If the lights turned on, FLY! If not, get some distance between the RC and the Drone then try again. If that also fails, check the radio modules and see if the drone gets the sent data. If that fails, disconnect the battery and repeat from step 2.

## üéÆ About the remote
>- The left hand mode, the left joystick controls the **PITCH** and **ROLL** movements and the button enable/disable throttle change. You can know if the throttle is disables when you see horizontal line 
under the "THR" on the screen. While the right joystick controls the **THROTTLE** and **YAW** movements and the buttons toggle the meregency landing.
