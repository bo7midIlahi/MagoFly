## ‚ú® What's MagoFly?
MagoFly is a drone capable of doing basic manoeuvres which is **controlled** by a **remote controller wirelessly** using **nRF24L01+ radio module**.

  - solder each of them on a seperate soldering board.
- change the SSID and the PASSWORD on the [`camera script`](.camera/CameraWebServer/CameraWebServer.ino) to your wifi' ssid and password:
  ```c
  //change these if needed
  const char *ssid = "elbo7's" ;
  const char *password = "NiggaNigga";
  ```
- Upload the code to each board.
- ****FLY!****

### üõ†Ô∏è Be cautious
- When labeling the BLDC motors in a clockwise direction: **1st** and **3rd**motors are spinning **Counter ClockWise**, **2nd** and **4th** spinning **ClockWise**.
- The drone **doesn't have** a **protocol** for when it **loses connection** with the RC. **In other words, it will hold the last inputs until it regain connection**.
- **Emergency Landing** and **CutOffEngine** are **irreversible**. After these actions are engaged, unplug the battery then re-plug it again if you want to fly the drone(**THIS WAS A SAFETY DESIGN**).
- The Drone is uncapable of doing diagonal movements. **So DO NOT move the joysticks is croos patterns!**

## üöÄ It's Flight Time
Follow this procedures:
- 1st: Power on the RC and **WAIT** for the animation to finish.

  />
- 2nd: Plug the battery connector and wait for the lights to flash.

    src="img/drone_flash_lights.gif"
    alt="drone"
    width=100%
  />
- 3rd: On the RC, click on the blue button (the toggle light) to see if there is a solid connection between thedrone and the RC.
- 4th: If the lights turned on, FLY! If not, get some distance between the RC and the Drone then try again. If that also fails, check the radio modules and see if the drone gets the sent data. If that fails, unplug the battery and repeat from step 2.

## üéÆ About the remote
- The left hand mode, the left joystick controls the **PITCH** and **ROLL** movements and the button enable/disable throttle change. You can know if the throttle is disables when you see horizontal line 
under the "THR" on the screen. While the right joystick controls the **THROTTLE** and **YAW** movements and the buttons toggle the meregency landing.
